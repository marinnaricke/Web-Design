                <p align="left">
                    When adopting an animal from our shelter, it
                    may have been rescued as a stray or previously in
                    poor care condition. <br />There may also be those of you
                    who have never had an animal before and this is your
                    first animal coming to your home.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For any of these circumstances, here are the steps
                    you need to take:

                <u><b>Before you bring your new dog home:</b></u>
                <ol class="list">
                    <li>
                        Determine where your dog will be spending
                        its time in the house. The best option may be
                        the kitchen for easy clean-up, in case the dog
                        has forgotten housebreaking rules while going
                        through a lot of different emotions.
                        <p></p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Make your house fitted for a dog. This would
                        mean storing any household chemicals away from reach
                        of the dog and installing baby gates in certain sections
                        of the house to prevent the pet from exploring all parts
                        of the house by itself.
                        <p></p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Training should start the first day you have the dog.
                        Begin trainging the dog with a vocabulary list you will
                        use with him/her to communicate with the dog and use the
                        same words over and over to prevent the dog from getting
                        confused with mutiple other words.
                        <p></p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        One last thing would be to buy the necessary items for
                        the dog ahead of time. These items could include food/water
                        bowls, dog food, collar, leash, and any other things needed
                        for the dog.
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <u><b>The first day you have the dog:</b></u>
                <ol class="list">
                    <li>
                        Introduce your new dog to your home and family before
                        introducing him/her to strangers.
                        <p></p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Ask our shelter about the dog's eating habits. This
                        would be what and when he/she was fed. It is a smart thing
                        to continue the dog's regular routine. If you want to switch
                        to a new brand of dog food, do this at a slow pace.
                        <p></p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Prepare a crate for the dog to be in on the ride home.
                        Some dog's find car trips to be stressful. A crate may make
                        the dog feel more comfortable rather than just place on a
                        car seat.
                        <p></p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Be prepared for the dog to have accidents in your home.
                        This may be caused by any stress of being at the shelter or
                        from its previous home. Just introduce the dog to training
                        and have it outside more than inside during the day.
                        <p></p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Lastly, remain calm with your new dog. Be patient and
                        try to avoid scolding the animal in rude ways.

                    <li>
                        Cats are a very territorial kind of animal. Prepare
                        an area for the animal to calls its home with food, water
                        and a litter box.
                        <p></p>

                    <li>
                        You need to prepare the litter box prior to getting
                        the cat. There should be one or two inches of litter, just
                        enough for the cat to feel comfortable doing its business.
                        <p></p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Prepare an area for the cat to scratch on things. There
                        are a number of scratching posts you can buy so that you
                        can save your furniture. Cats love to scratch to wear down
                        their claws.

                    <li>
                        Get the animal comfortable in your home. Sit on the floor
                        with the cat and let him/her come to you. If the cat doesn't
                        approach you, do it again at a later time. Give the animal time.
                        <p></p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Give the cat the same food it ate at the shelter. You can
                        gradually change the food over time, but keep it the same
                        for now.
