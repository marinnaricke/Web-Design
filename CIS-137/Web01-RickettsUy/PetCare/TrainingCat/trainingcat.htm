	<h3>Cat Training Tips!</h3>
	<p></p>
	Follow these easy tips to starting training right:
	<ol>
	   <li>Reward behaviors you like.</li>
	   <li>Use rewards to teach new behavior.</li>
	   <li>Reward immediately after a certain action
	   occurs. The cat will soon understand what is okay
	   and what is not okay.</li>
	   <li>Don't force your cat.</li>
	   <li>Don't turn your cat into a beggar</li>
	   <li>Never punish your cat. Cat's can obtain a bad
	   attitude and aren't good with connecting the punish
	   with the bad action she did</li>
	</ol>
