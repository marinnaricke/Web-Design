	<h3>Steps to take after adopting your pet</h3>
	<p></p>
	<p>When adopting an animal from our shelter, it
	may have been rescued as a stray or previously in
	poor care condition. There may also be those of you
	who have never had an animal before and this is your
	first animal coming to your home.</p>
	<p>For any of these circumstances, here are the steps
	you need to take:
	</p>

	<ul>
	 <li>Before you bring your new dog home:
	    <ol>
	       <li>Determine where your dog will be spending
		its time in the house. The best option may be
		the kitchen for easy clean-up, in case the dog
		has forgotten housebreaking rules while going
		through a lot of different emotions.
	       </li>
	       <li>Make your house fitted for a dog. This would
	       mean storing any household chemicals away from reach
	       of the dog and installing baby gates in certain sections
	       of the house to prevent the pet from exploring all parts
	       of the house by itself.
	       </li>
	       <li>Training should start the first day you have the dog.
	       Begin trainging the dog with a vocabulary list you will
	       use with him/her to communicate with the dog and use the
	       same words over and over to prevent the dog from getting 
	       confused with mutiple other words.

	       </li>
	       <li>One last thing would be to buy the necessary items for
	       the dog ahead of time. These items could include food/water
	       bowls, dog food, collar, leash, and any other things needed
	       for the dog.
	       </li>
	    </ol>
	 </li>
	 <li>The first day you have the dog:
	    <ol>
	       <li>Introduce your new dog to your home and family before
	       introducing him/her to strangers. 
	       </li>
	       <li>Ask our shelter about the dog's eating habits. This
	       would be what and when he/she was fed. It is a smart thing
	       to continue the dog's regular routine. If you want to switch
	       to a new brand of dog food, do this at a slow pace.
	       </li>
	       <li>Prepare a crate for the dog to be in on the ride home.
	       Some dog's find car trips to be stressful. A crate may make 
	       the dog feel more comfortable rather than just place on a 
	       car seat.
	       </li>
	       <li>Be prepared for the dog to have accidents in your home.
	       This may be caused by any stress of being at the shelter or
	       from its previous home. Just introduce the dog to training
	       and have it outside more than inside during the day.
	       </li>	
	       <li>Lastly, remain calm with your new dog. Be patient and
	       try to avoid scolding the animal in rude ways.
	       </li>	
	    </ol>
	 </li>
	</ul>

	<ul>
	 <li>Before you bring your new cat home:
	    <ol>
	       <li>Cats are a very territorial kind of animal. Prepare
	       an area for the animal to calls its home with food, water
	       and a litter box.
	       </li>
	       <li>You need to prepare the litter box prior to getting
	       the cat. There should be one or two inches of litter, just
	       enough for the cat to feel comfortable doing its business. 
	       </li>
	       <li>Prepare an area for the cat to scratch on things. There 
	       are a number of scratching posts you can buy so that you
	       can save your furniture. Cats love to scratch to wear down
	       their claws.

	       </li>
	    </ol>
	 </li>
	 <li>The first day you have the cat:
	    <ol>	
	       <li>Get the animal comfortable in your home. Sit on the floor
	       with the cat and let him/her come to you. If the cat doesn't
	       approach you, do it again at a later time. Give the animal time.
	       </li>
	       <li>Give the cat the same food it ate at the shelter. You can
	       gradually change the food over time, but keep it the same
	       for now.
	       </li>	
	    </ol>
	 </li>
	</ul>
