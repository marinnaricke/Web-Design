	<h3>Dog Training Tips!</h3>
	<p></p>
	Follow these 7 easy tips to begin the right training:
	<ol>
	   <li>Listen to your dog and your dog's needs.</li>
	   <li>Be generous with your affection and learn
	   to praise and scold with different behaviors.</li>
	   <li>Learn what your dog likes and reward your
	   dog for good behavior. Dog treats are always the
	   way to go.</li>
	   <li>Have your dog outside as much as possible.</li>
	   <li>Be consistent. Tell your dog no at appropriate
	   times and don't confuse your dog.</li>
	   <li>Have realistic expectations. The dog may not
	   always understand you, so be patient! Give your dog
	   time. Training can be a long process.</li>
	   <li>Feed your dog the right food. You want your dog
	   to be happy and grow strong.</li>
