	<h4><b>Background Information :</b></h4>
	<p>Homeless and abused animals are in need of good homes.
	More than 5,000 unwanted, abused and stray animals enter 
	the doors of the Loveable Animals Adoption and Rescue Shelter
 	each year. These animals can range from kittens, dogs,even 
	wildlife and exotic animals. Loveable Animals accepts all 
	animals in need.
	</p>
	<p>Many of the animals this shelter cares for were abandoned
	or given up by owners who can no longer care for them. Sadly
	some of the animals come to the shelter as victims of abuse or
	found on the roadside. Loveable Animals is working to improve
	the lives of Hampstead's homeless animals. Loveable Animals is
	a non-profit organization and encourages the community to donate
	so that we can provide the best shelter for these animals. Loveable
	Animals welcomes volunteer work and any local community help is
	much appreciated.With your help and the community we can do so
	much more to care for these animals until they find the right home.
	</p>

	<h4><b>Our goal :</b></h4>
	<p>Loveable Animals is aiming to be a true resource for the people
	and animals of Hampstead. We envision an animal shelter where all
	animals in good health and temperament find new homes, where
	they are housed in a low-stress, comfortable environment, where
	residents can turn in times of personal crisis for help with their
	pet, where citizens are educated on the proper care of animals,
	and where abused and neglected animals can receive the love and
	care they need to recover.
	</p>
	<p>We are very proud of the hard work and dedication our staff
	puts in to caring for these animals until they are in the best care
	of new owners. We are also proud of the accomplishments we have
	made as a organization, but we couldn't have done it without
	the continuing help of the Hampstead community.With your help,
	we can continue to achieve so much more than we have already.
	Our resources are limited and much of our work is done by volunteers.
	With the support of the Hampstead community, we can find homes for
	even more animals, improve our operations and the facility to meet
	the needs of the animals better, and work to prevent animal abuse
	and abandonment.Every animal should have the right to be happy in
	a warm and welcoming home.
